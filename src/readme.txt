INSTRUCTIONS ON SRC PACKAGE

Src contains all of the code that we (dpdk) consider our main opensource package.
Most code is unit tested and almost all production tested and should be ready for use.
Unit tests can be found in the test folder.
 
We do not, however, take any responsability for any bugs etc. that might occur when working with any code we provide.
See our license (MIT) in assets/license for more info on this.
